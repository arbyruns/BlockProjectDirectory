# BlockProjectDirectory
 
## Build tools & versions used
Xcode 13.3 

## Steps to run the app

Project can be ran within xCode simulator or on a device by downloading the project. For the purpose of this project I included a Update URL in the navigation bar for testing of a `Working URL`, `Malformed URL`, & `Empty URL`.

## What areas of the app did you focus on?

I focused on functionaility of the overall employee directory for the iPhone.

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?

While I believe design is import and has its place, I believe functionality should take priority and that was my reason for focusing on functionality to start.

## How long did you spend on this project?

About 4 hours

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?

With more time I would had like to focus on overall design for both iPad and iPhone device.

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

I feel the overall design is likely the weakest. While it's functional the design could use improvments.

## Did you copy any code or dependencies? Please make sure to attribute them here!

* SDWebImageSwiftUI to load images and caching
* A method from stack overflow to assit with phone number formatting. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32364055/formatting-phone-number-in-swift 

## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?

For the porject I wanted to utilize `async await` for iOS 15 as I felt it would be a perfect opportunity for a demo the API.

I utilzied a button to refresh data as well as a pulldown option to refresh data. I spent time and hooked up the email and phone functionality for this proect as well.  With the removal of the `Update URL` in the navigation bar I feel confident that this could be shipped as an app.
